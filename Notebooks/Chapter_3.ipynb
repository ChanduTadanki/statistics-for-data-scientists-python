    "- Intuition Behind Hypothesis testing:\n",
    "    - In hypothesis testing, there is null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis.\n",
    "    - In null hypothesis we have an assumption that we want to prove wrong.\n",
    "    - In alternate hypothese we have an assumption that we want to prove right\n",
    "    - For example, consider A/B Testing a new website design. While A/B Testing this new design, the null hypothesis is that the Older design is better.\n",
    "    - The alternate hypothesis will be that the new design is better than the old design. \n",
    "    - There may be many parameters from which we may descern this, but the idea was to give you a intuition behind what null and alternate hypothesis might be."
